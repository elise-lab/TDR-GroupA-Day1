# TDR-GroupB-Project 2
 Jupyter Notebooks for Project 2
# All data is pentagon data

## Persistent Cohomology Pentagon - [insert surface] : 
Jupyter notebooks where we upload the data, computer persistence diagrams, do PCA, TDR, Hover data, and unfolding on the respective sampled surface data

## [insert surface] - images :
File with the needed images for hover data, may not be up to date with the most recently created data sample

## DEMO 0 - [insert title] :
Notebooks from Dr. Perea's DREimac documentation GitHub page. ComplexProj was useful in displaying the unfolding cuts for our surfaces. Movingdot was useful for applying geodesic distance computations to the sphere data

## QData and M5-data-gen :
Notebooks where our data sets have been generated and the code needed for that to occur

## New Strat Pentagon Generation/Pentagon Generation :
Notebooks where our sampling algorithm was written.

## .py files :
definitions.py is called to get our algorithm
reconfig.py is called when generating new data

## Spreadsheets folder :
Contains the excel files of sampled data
 
## data folder :
Contains sorted sampled data on txt files

## iframe_figures folder :
Contains a depiction of genus 3 PCA [old version]

## standard_form_analysis :
Contains code for turning the space of equilateral pentagons into its standard form
